# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** A developer can run `meet record`, stop it, and get structured notes in Notion — all without touching the internet or installing meeting bots.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — local-transcription

## Current Status

- [x] Project initialized
- [x] Research completed (STACK, FEATURES, ARCHITECTURE, PITFALLS)
- [x] REQUIREMENTS.md defined (40 v1 requirements)
- [x] ROADMAP.md defined (6 phases)
- [x] Phase 1: Audio Capture + Health Check Design
  - [x] Plan 01: Project scaffold + core modules (config, storage, state) + Wave 0 test stubs
  - [x] Plan 02: Audio capture pipeline (process_manager, audio service, meet record/stop)
  - [x] Plan 03: Health check system (meet doctor + meet init)
- [ ] Phase 2: Local Transcription
- [ ] Phase 3: Note Generation
- [ ] Phase 4: Notion Integration
- [ ] Phase 5: Integrated CLI
- [ ] Phase 6: Exportable Git Repo

## Last Session

**Stopped at:** Phase 3 context gathered
**Date:** 2026-03-22T20:23:53Z
**Duration:** ~4 minutes

## Decisions

- Used `setuptools.build_meta` backend (not `setuptools.backends._legacy`) — required for setuptools 82+
- ffmpeg device indices `:1` (BlackHole system audio) and `:2` (MacBook microphone) — never device names
- SIGTERM to process group first, wait 5s, then SIGKILL escalation for clean ffmpeg termination
- Atomic state.json via temp+replace (POSIX rename) for crash-safe session tracking
- HealthCheck ABC with abstractmethod — direct instantiation raises TypeError by design
- BlackHoleCheck checks device NAME at index (not just index reachability) per pitfall P1
- DiskSpaceCheck returns WARNING (not ERROR) below 5GB — non-fatal advisory
- meet init triggers 1-second avfoundation test recording to force macOS mic permission prompt (SETUP-02)
- [Phase 02]: Language auto-detect: omit language kwarg entirely when None — passing None causes mlx-whisper to default to en
- [Phase 02]: run_with_spinner uses threading.Thread for background mlx-whisper; Rich Live spinner renders in main thread
- [Phase 02]: Session stem derived from wav_path.stem not a stored UUID for correct --session round-trip
- [Phase 02]: WhisperModelCheck returns WARNING not ERROR when model not cached — model auto-downloads on first meet transcribe (D-08)
- [Phase 02]: No version pin on mlx-whisper in pyproject.toml — already installed and API is stable
- [Phase 02]: ensure_dirs() called first in transcribe() — prevents silent failure on fresh install before data dirs created
- [Phase 02]: OSError added to transcribe exception handler as defense-in-depth for Python 3.14 glob behavior

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration (s) | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|-------|
| 01    | 02   | 244         | 2     | 20    |
| 01    | 03   | 225         | 2     | 7     |
| Phase 02 P01 | 3 | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 02 P02 | 78 | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 02 P03 | 124 | 1 tasks | 2 files |

## Key Context for Future Sessions

- Tech stack is fully validated and locked — do not suggest alternatives
- ffmpeg uses device INDICES (:1, :2), never device names
- WAV only — never .m4a
- mlx-whisper, not insanely-fast-whisper
- llama3.1:8b, not llama3.2
- LLM prompt must include strict grounding rule (no fabricated decisions/next steps)
- meet doctor architecture designed in Phase 1 — each subsequent phase adds its own checks
- Architecture: XDG Base Dir, pluggable health checks, process groups for ffmpeg, atomic state writes
- Package installed via `pip install -e .` in a fresh venv (Python 3.14)
- HealthCheck ABC pattern: subclass must implement check() -> CheckResult, register in HealthCheckSuite
